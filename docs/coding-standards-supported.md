# âœ… Enhance Your C/C++ Projects with CppDepend's Coding Standards

As a C/C++ developer, adhering to coding standards is essential for creating high-quality, maintainable, and efficient software.  
CppDepend's comprehensive coding standards provide a robust framework of guidelines, best practices, and techniques to help you streamline your development process and ensure your code is clean, optimized, and easy to understand.

## ðŸ”§ Why Coding Standards Matter

- Improve **code readability** and maintainability  
- Reduce **bugs and security vulnerabilities**  
- Facilitate **team collaboration** and onboarding  
- Ensure **compliance** with industry-specific safety and quality standards  

## ðŸš€ CppDepend Supports Industry-Standard Guidelines

CppDepend integrates with the most widely adopted coding standards in the industry:

---

### âœ… CERT C

The **CERT C Coding Standard** defines secure coding rules for C language programs. It aims to reduce vulnerabilities and prevent undefined behaviors by covering topics such as:
- Buffer overflows
- Integer overflows
- Memory leaks
- Input validation
CppDepend helps identify and enforce compliance with CERT C rules in real time.

---

### âœ… CERT C++

The **CERT C++ Coding Standard** extends the CERT C standard to C++, addressing object-oriented features like:
- Constructor/destructor misuse
- Inheritance and polymorphism pitfalls
- Exception safety
CppDepend provides detection of violations and guides developers toward secure and robust C++ code.

---

### âœ… MISRA C

**MISRA C** is a set of guidelines developed for safety-critical systems, particularly in automotive and embedded systems. It focuses on:
- Predictable and analyzable code
- Avoiding dangerous or undefined constructs
CppDepend enforces MISRA C:2012 and earlier versions, ideal for automotive and medical devices.

---

### âœ… MISRA C++

**MISRA C++** provides best practices for using C++ in safety-critical environments. It emphasizes:
- Determinism
- Type safety
- Avoidance of complex language features
CppDepend supports **MISRA C++:2023**, the most recent version, and helps ensure safe and reliable C++ software.

---

### âœ… CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

The **CWE** is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types. Common examples include:
- Null pointer dereference
- Resource leaks
- Use-after-free errors
CppDepend maps its rules to CWE identifiers, helping teams detect and resolve vulnerabilities aligned with industry security standards.

---

### âœ… AUTOSAR C++ 2014

**AUTOSAR C++14** is a coding standard tailored for automotive software development. It addresses C++11/14 usage in embedded systems, focusing on:
- Safe usage of modern C++ features
- Real-time constraints
- Object lifecycle management
CppDepend helps developers adhere to AUTOSAR rules while taking advantage of modern C++ capabilities.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Benefits of Using CppDepend's Standards

- Get **automatic detection** of rule violations  
- Customize or extend rules to suit your development needs  
- Gain **insightful reports** and visualizations of rule compliance  
- Integrate into your CI/CD pipelines for **continuous quality checks**
