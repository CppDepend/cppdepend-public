# ðŸ§  CQLinq in CppDepend â€“ Use Cases and Best Practices

**CQLinq** (Code Query LINQ) is a powerful domain-specific query language built into CppDepend. It allows teams to inspect, enforce, and continuously monitor architectural rules, maintainability metrics, and coding standards across C/C++ codebases.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Can You Do with CQLinq?

- âœ… Create and enforce custom architectural constraints
- âœ… Detect risky, complex, or unmaintainable code
- âœ… Track technical debt over time
- âœ… Monitor rule violations (MISRA, CERT, CWE)
- âœ… Customize dashboards and reports with your own logic

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example Use Cases

### 1. Find Methods with High Cyclomatic Complexity

```csharp
from m in Methods where m.CyclomaticComplexity > 20 select m
```

Identify methods that may need refactoring for clarity and testability.

---

### 2. Prevent Layering Violations

```csharp
warnif count > 0
from t in Types 
where t.IsUsing("UI") && t.IsDeclaredIn("Core")
select t
```

Ensure code layering is respectedâ€”e.g., Core should not depend on UI.

---

### 3. Track Newly Introduced Technical Debt

```csharp
from i in Issues
where i.Severity == Severity.High && i.OccurredInThisVersion
select i
```

Catch critical issues introduced since the last version.

---

### 4. Audit MISRA Violations

```csharp
from r in Rules
where r.Name.Contains("MISRA") && r.HasBeenViolated
select r
```

Useful for certification reports and compliance preparation.

## ðŸ§° How to Use CQLinq

1. Open the VisualCppDepend dashboard
2. Navigate to **Queries and Rules**
3. Create or edit a CQLinq query
4. Run the query and inspect results
5. Optionally enforce via quality gates or CI

---

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard & Report Integration

- Add queries to dashboards and reports
- Visualize rule violations in treemaps or charts
- Export results in HTML or JSON format
- Filter by module, layer, scope, or severity

---

## ðŸš€ Start Writing Custom Rules

CppDepend ships with 200+ default queries covering metrics, maintainability, standards, and design. You can edit these or create new ones.
